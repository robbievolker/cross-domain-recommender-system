# cross-domain-recommender-system
This is a cross-domain recommender system, allowing you to input books, films and videogames you have consumed. The system will generate an interactive knowledge graph using D3.js based on titles recommended by other users. You are also encouraged to add tags to the titles you log, and to upvote tags left by other users.
